  * Public function starts with capitalized word. Private function starts with non-capitalized word. Function name must start the line. Order of the functions in the module is alphabetical.

  * Function arguments all start with capitalized word. Local variables always start with small letter (the rest is CamelCase style). The case switching for same variable shouldn't be done.

  * Subroutines local to the function have the same name as function (unless there are more then 1).

  * No comment in the function body starts the line.

  * Documentation is in Natural Doc format. Sections with no need for information should be skipped. Ndoc function comments are set in multiline comment style with the ending token having one space before it.

  * Tab spaces used: 4
